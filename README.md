## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python and scikit-learn package. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using the major economic indicator data from the World Bank to better understand:

1. Can the national GDP be reasonably modeled via some other economic indicators?
2. What are the trade-offs between number of features (complexity) vs. model performance?
3. Which minimal set of features gives the best choice?

The data was downloaded from the World Bank at https://databank.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD/1ff4a498/Popular-Indicators# and it is publicly aavailable.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  The notebooks is self-exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@fangbingw/class-project-randomforestregressor-dced10848717).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to the World Bank for the data.  You can check the Licensing for the data at the URL https://databank.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD/1ff4a498/Popular-Indicators#.  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
